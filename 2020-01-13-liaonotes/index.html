                <p><b><a href="https://luminghao.com/liao">click here to listen/download to liao</a></b></p>
                <p>
                    liao is an album i drafted soon after a previous album of
                    music titled "acceptable" in 2011. over the previous
                    almost-decade, i made and discarded numerous attempts to
                    arrange and produce it, making it a specter of preempted
                    mid-life crisis or something (i.e it was the frequent
                    subject of birthday-night anxiety and introspective shame).
                    every year it stayed in an intimidating state of
                    incompleteness, the juvenile title seemed to ring more and
                    more true: laughably, liao was originally an acronym for
                    "life is already over", where an embarrassing 21 year old me
                    wanted to create an album around the themes of media
                    ecosystems and teleology. every year it seemed more
                    depressing to spend adult life resuscitating the amateur
                    musical voice of a college student, and incredibly
                    unproductive to commit to a time-consuming project where i
                    was sure the final product could only be something i could
                    share in context of a self-effacing joke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    however, as much as i am fantastically relived to finally
                    close this neurotic chapter of my life (or more so, for the
                    new acquisition of psychological space for more chapters of
                    neuroticism), i have been surprisingly extremely enthralled
                    with the results. you are the ultimate judge but i think a
                    more productive route towards my goal of a partial-treatment
                    on ecologies media technologies was to focus on acts of
                    archiving sound documents and technologies of analog
                    understanding and attempted recreation in abstracted digital
                    environments. i think what ultimately lead to this most
                    recent 1.5-2 year attempt resulting in conclusion is a
                    combinational series of chance encounters with treasured
                    tools, techniques, concepts, pedagogy, discussion, technical
                    epiphanies and personal compromises, as well as an
                    unexpected newfound wealth of creative and social support. i
                    felt repeatedly "propelled" by small successes and
                    stabilized during periods of creative confusion because of
                    friends and mentors i.e. "lucky". my method for assessing
                    "doneness" of music is to attempt to listen ad nauseam, with
                    a focus on level of annoyance/boredom. it's my hope that
                    others will only be moderately annoyed listening to this
                    project, the way i am surprised and happy to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i'd like to share technical documentation of different
                    aspects of the project on this page for anyone interested. i
                    plan to publish this document 2020-01-13 in incomplete form,
                    as i assume only about three people will actually read this
                    page. however, if there is some particular aspect or
                    technique or source you are wondering about, please just
                    email me (lh00000000 at gmail) and i will take a less lazy
                    approach. until then, please consider this page to be in perpetual state of incompleteness.

                <h2>cover art</h2>
                <p>
                    the original concept for the album art was a simple grid
                    mosaic of pictures of the sky, the only restriction that one
                    day could only be represented in one photo. i took 194
                    photographs over the course of 2012 but eventually gave up
                    as progress on producing the album became bleaker and
                    bleaker. </p>
                    <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2020/siteassets/liaonotes/ldoe.png" width="400px">
                    <p>upon deciding to conclude my work on the album last
                    year, i decided that the grid should be arranged according
                    to a similarity metric (i used tsne), however because i
                    wanted a square ratio of height to width, and because i
                    wanted to exhibit the photos as occupying a folder on a
                    macos file system, i decided on a dimensionality of 8x8. in
                    my opinion, the preservation of similarity is not
                    noticeable, especially with the particular images i
                    selected. however, i am still satisfied with the visual
                    inclusion of the file system that was also heavily used to
                    create the musical content of the project. as of 2020-01-13
                    it is unclear if cdbaby's automated cover art
                    partner-restriction enforcement will allow me to retain any
                    elements of this though. stay tuned lol.

                <h2>squeeze technique at beginning of wwcd</h2>
                <p>the synthesized tone at the beginning of wwcd is the first bar of wwcd looped with increasingly earlier loop end times to achieve different pitches. for a very long time, i have tried to figure out a method to use small sections of music as sources for wavetable/granular synthesis in order to glissando into bass frequencies so low that new sections of music would sound "revealed" from the micro-time periods of the piece. i tried and failed many times but it turned out the solution was a simple bit of python and discovering how straightforward the wav format translated to numerical array processing in python.</p>
                <p>i previously posted code snippets <a href="http://luminghao.com/2019-06-19-squeezehit/">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>snapshots</h2>
                <p>maybe it is just me, but i think i will helpful to share my snapshotting process in detail one day. basically, while working on the songs, i would render copies and archive them in 2020-01-13-title.wav format in s3 (i'd like to switch from s3 to digital ocean's soon but i haven't gotten around to it yet), then walk around listening to the wav using the cloudbeats app, which is the only non-bullshit music syncing ios app i have found after many many failed attempts. to give myself a simulated sense of deadline-like-motivation, i would post whole-album states on my blog using <a href="http://luminghao.com/blog/#liao">the #liao tag on my blog page</a>. i don't have any sort of tracking mechanism for my website (UPDATE-2020-01-19: i put a google tag on luminghao.com/liao in order to run a google ad campaign on people from des moines, iowa (my birth state) who have shown interested in either "diners", "dj mixers", or "productivity software". i feel weird about it but i figured it's as good a time as any to actually see what the process for making a google ad is like) (it's static files hosted on github pages and i prefer to bloat my pages with annoying javascript and css libraries instead of analytics pixels) so it was a fake sense of publicness but i guess it worked for me.</p>
