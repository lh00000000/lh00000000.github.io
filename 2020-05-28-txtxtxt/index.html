        <div style="color: white;"><p>this is a webapp i made for a job application at postlight in like, feb 2018... the prompt was to make an employee directory site using react/redux so i thought it'd be a fun idea to make some kind of thing where every time a new person 'joined the company', they'd make an edit to a collective piece of ascii art. i was also playing around with the idea that things of visual design could focus more on being interesting in how their tools to make them are orientated. code is here <a href="https://github.com/lh00000000/txtxtxt.club" target="_blank">here</a>. </p><p>i got good feedback on the app but wasn't contacted by the company again. why am i posting this? 1. i guess did put a lot time and thought into it. i wasn't even really looking for a new job at the time, i just saw the opening and honestly wanted to work there lol. 2. now that i'm NEET-ing, i guess i'm just slogging through my documentation backlog without a lot of curation as to what i really want to focus on "showing the world". don't really know who looks at this blog anyways. 3. i'm applying for jobs and i assume some people want samples + many jobs want react js experience. my relationship with react these days is that its basically a step up from html for me, in that i will default to it when i just want to make a webpage, but it's kind of boring so i don't really think of it when am more concerned with trying to realize something interesting functionality-wise. so here it is, to-who-it-may-concern; hope you find it fun or something.</p>
