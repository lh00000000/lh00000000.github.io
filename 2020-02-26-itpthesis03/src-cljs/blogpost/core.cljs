This was my second visit, but fortunately, this time, the room of sorting machinery was turned off for maintenance tasks. The guide guesses that they were switching out conveyor belts. At that moment, the was a cherry picker driver and cherry picker operator, surveying a narrow region between two large shafts a couple of yards away from the viewing balcony. I couldn&#39;t tell what they were looking at. I thought it was particularly demonstrative that they were using a cherry picker to simply assess the situation. The conveyor belts of the machinery reach up 2-3 stories. It makes sense that one needs special equipment to simply achieve visibility when mechanism has expanded larger than individual-human-scale, or is it when mechanism allows for the extension of human-scale vision that one develops faith in structures of mechanism beyond familiar scale.
