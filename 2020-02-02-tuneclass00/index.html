                    <p>the new york school of piano tuning, service, and repair is located in a.c. pianocraft, which is apparently the oldest piano restoration shop in nyc. ac pianocraft was founded by five steinway crafstpeople during the 60s when steinway got the reputation that their quality had dramatically dropped, creating a new market of restoration labor for pianos from the steinway "golden age" of the 20s. </p>

                    <h2>finally tuning</h2>
                    <p>after a brief walkthrough of all the screws on the case, which is apparently a source of a lot of piano regulation labor (being a vibrating hunk of wood), we finally started working on "tuning", or the dynamics of tuning hammers and bridge pins.</p>

                    <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2020/siteassets/tuneclass00/actionmodel.jpg" width="100%" />
                    <img src="https://lh00000000-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2020/siteassets/tuneclass00/underlevers.jpg" width="100%" />

                    <p>learning about piano tuning for me so far has been learning about more and more unexpected sources of frustrations and anxieties complicating the general concept of "tighten the strings so they're the right note". two of these frustrations are flagpoling, where the weight of the hammer and direction of the twisting motion on the bridge pin results in an unavoidable temporary bending of the pin. this bent state makes the string sound slightly higher than it will instantly fall back to, making listening to its pitch inaccurate. one method of compensating for flagpoling is to keep the hammer at a sharp angle with the direction of the string, so the pin will be bent perpendicular to the direction of the string. this is because being the pin the same direction of the string would result in maximum pitch change.</p>
                    <p>another source of anxiety is "twist" which simply refers to the pin being twisted when tightened to loosened. this means that the material of the pin will jump back into place, making listening in the moment an inaccurate representation of eventual pitch of the string. even though the pin might be of hard metal, considerations imagining if the pin were a floppy noodle must still be taken into account. the solution to compensate for this in practice this is to add a small bump of turn in the opposite direction of intender turn direction to "take the twist out"</p>

                    <h2>damper types</h2>
                    <p>Lou (the instructor and veteran tuner) listed many signs of sloppy tuning and regulation work. many of them seemed to fall under the category of not realizing or respecting where miniscule wear from string contact would accumulate, making small grooves that would unnecessarily damage some part or component if not respected in a future adjustment. although not really a result of wear and more of intended design, one site for this respect for the placement of the details of string placement is in the variety of damper heads, correlated with the allocation of strings per pitch (bass strings are usually single strings. middle range is usually three strings per pitch. upper is usually two) </p>
