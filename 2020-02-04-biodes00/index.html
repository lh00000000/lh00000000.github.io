        <p>taking <a href="http://www.stefanibardin.net/biodesign2020/">http://www.stefanibardin.net/biodesign2020/</a> and was assigned to respond to four articles for the first week</p>
        <br>
        <h2>response to NASA - Food for Space Flight</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_Food_for_Space_Flight.html">NASA - Food for Space Flight | NASA</a></p>
        <p>Why space food interesting?</p>
        <p>Is it similarly interesting to how food of the prison system is interesting to people?</p>
        <p>Is it interesting because of adaptations differing from domestic middle-class western environment</p>
        <p>Is it similar to the leisurely pursuit of camping</p>
        <p>In "The Interface", John Harwood describes how the wide array of different methods of real estate acquisition led to IBM's association with multiplicity of architectural styles, and when the corporation began to commission new works, it preserved this dynamic of eclectic exteriors. This is because of the absence of unifying surfaces and contexts was an insistence on the level of control these buildings housed. IBM existed everywhere and in every form, the rhetoric claimed, because IBM is not anywhere or not any singular form. IBM claimed stressed they existed as the invisible, the cognitive, infrastructure between the places. Harwood describes this aspiration as "a counterenvironment, a space organized in contradistinction to the environment by annexing part of space and defining itself negatively with respect to that space".</p>
        <p>The geometric and unfamiliar packaging of food distribution mechanisms of NASA are inspiration for the designer because they are testament of the powers of modern product design to replicate the infrastructures that incubate the existence of "the designer", through the creation of domestic consumption, virtually anywhere. Dining rooms, tables, shrimp, the neutrality of chicken, utensils, warmth. Many things do not have be sacrificed when a new arm of the refrigerated shipping network is connected to the networks of agriculture and food manufacturing labor on earth.</p>

        <h2>response to Space Food Experiences: Designing Passenger's Eating Experiences for Future Space Travel Scenarios  </h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2019.00003/full">Frontiers | Space Food Experiences: Designing Passenger's Eating Experiences for Future Space Travel Scenarios | Computer Science</a></p>
        <p>"It is known, however, that food has a multi-dimensional and multi-sensorial role in societies and that sensory, hedonic, and social features of eating and food design should not be underestimated." - This reads as an herculean effort to describe culture using only its physiological efforts. The task of creating hedonic food in non-earth environments is identical to the task meeting the logistical demands of reproducing food culture non-earth environments. </p>
        <br>
        <p>"(given future space tourism)" - The work is based on the combination of assumed inevitability of the luxury space-tourism industry and the utility the future existence of this industry grants to this research effort. I have no personal opinion about the timeliness of this new luxury industry, but one wonders about the effects that poor food quality would have on a hypothetical luxury space tourism market. Would it drive away potential revenue? Would it save the industry operating costs? Would the industry be unable to maintain financial viability and disappear? What would the societal effects of a failed luxury space-tourism industry be?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The article repeatedly mentions a few qualities that an HCI-inspired approach to food products is uniquely able to generate such as:</p>
        <p>Reflection - Reactive to daily physical activity data. However it is unclear whether presenting data according to subjectively created mappings is more illustrative of the data than other methods, such as providing documentation about the nuances and shortcoming of the data collection method.</p>
        <p>Surprise - such 2d to 3d pasta shapes. But how many times can you be surprised by the same foodstuff? How many times would one want to be surprised with the same foodstuff? The majority of popular pasta shapes have reached ubiquity because of their physical reaction to being cooked, as well as cheap method of creation (usually by hand or high-scale mechanization) so it is unclear to me how an last-mile extrusion process has advantages in the world of pasta-shape making</p>

Words associated to categories to aid in numeric (summing) operation with assumption towards mutually-exclusivity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Spice Bomb Mixing - to address the problem of liquid seasonings not being "fun" yet being practical they used solid shapes placed into a container for shaking. The solids somehow dissolve in a way that do not exhibit the same messiness of liquids or particle seasoning? But I am confused as to how. </p>
        <br>
        <p>3d Food Printer - Do xyz assemblies word in microgravity? How many source material reservers are needed? In the picture it only showed three. The "Functional, Sensorial, Emotional, Social" seem like objectives, not descriptions of how these proposals achieve any of those dimensions. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Earth Memory Bites - Selling 360 video and printing standardized packets of combinatory flavored balls is proposed as a solution to homesickness.</p>

        <h2>response to  Conversion of Food Waste to Fermentation Products</h2>

        <ul><li>theme - pretreatment + heat + more time = more product
        </li><li>products being things valuable to the petrochemical industry

        <h2>response to "Mars Garden: an Engineered Greenhouse for a Sustainable Residence on Mars"</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.stefanibardin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mars-Garden-AIAA-Propulsion.pdf">https://www.stefanibardin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mars-Garden-AIAA-Propulsion.pdf</a></p>
        <p>questions</p>
        <ul><li>how is this decided
        <ul><li>    "The manual tasks are those that cannot initially be completed by robots, or are planned as psychologically beneficial tasks for the astronauts; while some harvest tasks can be completed robotically, they are considered emotionally fulfilling and are therefore suggested to be completed by humans. "
        </li><li>   "considered to provide psychological benefits to the crew. "
        </li></ul></li><li>source of nutrient coating and replenishment mechanism
        <ul><li>    circulation of human and plant waste?
        <ul><li>        urea?
        </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>led system + computer vision power source
        <ul><li>    "The greenhouse is powered with six Kilopower nuclear reactors that produce 10 kWe each "
        </li><li>   "While this number is high, it is largely unavoidable; plants require a certain amount of power to grow, and the purpose of the greenhouse is to grow these plants.
        </li></ul></li><li>rail system is determined by assumed height of plant?
        </li></ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>guess many of the questions above are answered by designing for a set amount of time i.e. temporary structure </p>
