     [:p [:span]] [:p [:span  "Why do many biodesign projects that address the food system utilize the aesthetics of science (fiction) (I am referring to lab coats, test tubes, transparent packaging, syringes and pipettes, sterile rooms, cold lighting, metrology, and orthogonality)? The optics of aligning a design provocation with the institution of science is an effective and productive way to conjure suspensions of disbelief when thinking about dramatic systematic and cultural changes. Many projects within the world of “biodesign” lean on visual and linguistic cues to align the pieces with the creative lineages of science fiction. Science fiction, historically, has been an arena for the exploration, dissection, and refutations of utopias and dystopias. The objectives of many biodesign projects are systemic and radical social and infrastructural change via widespread proliferation of individual behavioral change. By co-opting the markers of science fiction, many biodesign projects essentially offer a sneak-peak towards a possible what’s-to-come, teasing and hinting at the concept of “future” both as a mechanism for ideological self-sustainment and self-justification of practicality through the communication of cultural “trickle-down” strategy."]] [:p [:span  "At a recent panel I attended regarding the methodologies of luxury fashion designers using reused or recycled fabrics in their work as an attempt to address the climate crisis (either to “raise awareness” or “democratize solutions”), the practice of conserving a bond with the realm of “luxury” was justified as “the business of rewriting the cultural code”. Many biodesign projects utilize the channels of luxury cuisine in a similar vein. While the utilization of unfamiliar foodstuffs, techniques, and tools might immediately be directed towards creating a luxury commodity of unique sensation and/or novelty, the rationale of many of these pieces is that widespread behavioral adoption can be achieved through creating “aspirational” consumable experiences, that hopefully initially attract the moneyed and later inspire “the rest” i.e. achieve commercial “scale”. How does one create one of these “aspirational” consumables in a neoliberal market of individualistic discerning citizens-as-consumers-as-customers? Many of the requirements for doing this are part of a coveted and profitable body of marketing knowledge that is valuable mainly for its obscurity. One commensensual tenet of this body of knowledge is aestheticization of the goods. "]] [:p [:span  "Aestheticization of food has many physiological functionality, i.e. food normally looks “good” partially because of associations with other schemas of foods previously empirically proven to be delicious, nutriousnes, or simply safe. Another important dimension of food aestheticization is social communication. Visual identifiers differentiate foods, cultural aligning some foodstuffs to some demographics and social associations, and separating the those same foodstuffs from others. One recurring challenge for presentations of novel biodesign projects whose potential infrastructural effectiveness relies on a cascading event of viral adoption is to aestheticize. Initially, this aestheticization implements a bonding with the item’s alignment with “aspirational” commodity status. If this bonding succeeds, aestheticization is then used to confirm and validate the later act of purchase and consumption as indeed a manifestation and achievement of acceptance of that consumptive aspiration."]] [:p [:span  "This method utilizes, assumes, and reifies the structures of conspicuous consumption under neoliberal capitalism, rarely attempting to critique or question the merits of this socioeconomic/political system, instead relying on the self-organization of “consumption work”. What this project attempts to do is propose yet another chapter in pattern of aestheticization. However, what this project proposes is an aestheticization towards a teleology of aestheticization of food. Like many projects of biodesign, this affordances this project grants itself are mainly in the form of systemic acceptances, rather than affordances of technological or material feasibility taken by design projects of many other fields. Many projects of biodesign that address the food system are motions towards scientific rationality as a solution to global crises, such as the international project of “sustainability” (i.e. efficiency w.r.t. waste)  and the equitable distribution of means towards adequate nutrition. Taking a page from the book of ideology of industrial-scientificism, one method towards a more concerted effort towards improvement defined by rationality is the practice of blackboxing. With blackboxing, the loss of visibility towards an object of focus is a price paid for increased attention towards the visibility of the peripheral effects of the object of focus. This project is a series of various methods towards the boxing, and making-into-box, of food, either via containment or manufactured form. "]] [:p [:span  " What this project could possibly defeat is the perceived necessity of cognitive and cultural labor required to establish the visual identification and association of novel food solutions in efforts towards widespread consumer appeal. This project possibly disarms questions of cultural baggage in the selection of packing material. As long as requirements for dimensions, thermal performance, toxicity, ease-of-serviceability, and fabrication cost minimums are met, focus can then be directed towards minimizing the environmental impact towards production and maintenance of the packaging system. Focus can then be directed towards creating logistical infrastructure towards the sustained reuse and municipal stewardship of the system. The visual homogenization of the food itself could shift the lens towards environmental impact, nutritional efficacy, and taste rather than cultural pressures of social identification. This project’s obvious limitations, like many projects in the realm of biodesign, are situated mostly in its reproduction of a free-market system of conspicuous consumption. These limitations then become a strength of the proposal, becoming a method for illuminating the limitations of many “biodesign” efforts towards systemic change. Blackboxing abolishes internal visibility to amplify peripheral clarity.

Internal chamber is defined approximately as a 3x3x3” empty volume, with 0.5” taper in the corners (to aid in content-removal and washing operations). Lids are regulated to extend down the side of the container by one inch. Identification code for the foodstuff is implemented via physical protrusions on the bottom of the container.

Foodstuffs are compressed into containers so that force necessary to use the extraction utensil (detailed in the next section) stays around 0.25 lb of pressure, with a standard deviation of 0.1 lb.
