["When Gorne is describing the movements of her piece Tao, she describes working archetypically with wood using \"material and energy models\". I found this interesting because I also have been thinking about using the resonant qualities of materials as a proxy for materiality, however, Gorne also talks about using this sonic representation as a generalized symbol for wood, forests, the Amazon forest, and specifically the profiteering at the expense of the Amazon. I am interested in this duality between acting as a demonstration of the particular and appearing as a representative of the general that I think comes very natural to the medium of music, but I tend to have difficulty working in the latter mode.\n My hesitation to embrace working archetypically with sound is that any analysis or comparison between the instance and the archetype dissolves the fidelity of the relationship between the two. The use of signal processing algorithms upon a digitally stored recording of a wooden sound (synthesized or not), if interpreted as a symbol for wood being denatured at a particularly urgent ecological scale, seems to beg the question of limitations, and thus distance from reality, of the representation. Most of the examples I have personally experienced of this modality being effective requires some sort of distracting context to prevent deconstruction of conceptual monoliths. For example, hearing bel canto in a movie to suggest a character is a fan of opera and thus fits the socioeconomic stereotypes of that characterization. The archetypical power of the iconized sound breaks down if someone if particular familiar with opera, recognizing the recording was published on a collection curated in aims of the democratization of the genre. Another example is hearing a quick melodic line implemented by a distorted electric guitar to suggest rebelliousness or nostalgia. The association breaks down if someone is familiar with the conservative culture around American rock music, or with the sophistication of the commercial algorithmic method used to create the distorted timbre. My fear is that archetypical methodologies assume too little of a listener's experience and criticality to function in a way that avoids suspicions of artistic neglect.","Gorne mentions text as an advantageous component of a musical work because it allows the listener the option to reread and analyze semi-nonlinearity for temporal connections. This made me appreciate text for its cultural baggage, since it seems able to maintain the ambiguity, complexity, and pedagogical infrastructure necessary for repeated analysis when newly-invented forms of notation might be limited to the performance concerns momentarily present in the composer / notation designer at the time (limitations of traditional notation assumed to be obvious).","I am not initially sure about the interpretation that spatiality a new additional parameter to the production of (electronic?) musical work. Additionally, I am not sure I believe in the compositional practicality of a model that focuses on parameterization between \"pitch, duration, intensity, and timbre\" other than in the practice of generating individual sounds. What is more central to the medium of music to me is relationality to past, future, and simultaneous sounds, appearing as aggregations of time and synchronicity, and in tension with possibility or in context of constraint. I think of spatiality as the primary vehicle for the communication of sociological context, as it is the aural quality that communicates place and material conditions for the event of the work being heard.","Gorde describes technology as \"simply a tool\". I would respond and say tools are technicalities that carry culture and political, and the technical itself is deeply integrated with a societies conceptualization of life's place in the universe. If we can say tools can be bluntly split into two layers, interface and mechanism, mechanism is a mirror image of sociological history and material circumstance and interface is curation and framing of what is \"valued\" within the space of possibility within that materiality. I would say that all tools are fundamentally restrictive to some degree of any vision or intent possible and that a critical approach to them is a fruitful place to incubate worthwhile discourse about humanities existence."]
